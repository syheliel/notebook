# 面向对象四大特征 
## Inheritance (泛化)
Inheritance is a way of relating two classes so that one class may use another class's members without redefining them. 
## Polymorphism(多态)
Original meaning: “Having many forms”
The sender of a stimulus doesn’t need to know the receiver’s class.
Different receivers can interpret the message in their own way.
## Encapsulation(封装)
Encapsulation is the process of hiding the implementation details of an object. 
The only access to manipulate the object data is through its interface. 
## 抽象
Giving the user the minimal interface possible 

## Interface(接口,不是面向对象的特征)
The interface should completely describe how users of the class interact with the class
